The purpose of this assignment is to give you the opportunity to manipulate, display, and compute features from raw data using Python with JupyterLab or VSCode. Over the course of this assignment, you will be guided through a process of manually finding interesting phenomena in a data set. There is no specific process that will work for all data sets, but this specific process should give you a feel for how you would initially analyze your own data set that youâ€™ll find for your course project.
