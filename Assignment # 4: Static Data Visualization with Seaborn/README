Your task and the instruction:
Take a look at this doc and read the instructions.
Choose a dataset from seaborn package's repository.
Based on your goal, do explaratory data analysis (eda) with visual components from, mainly, the Seaborn pack. It is ok to use
other non-interactive visualization packs.
You can use other packs to clean/organize data.
Practice the visualization codes in the first five Python Workshops.
Browse the seaborn gallery (it is in the seaborn workshop). Probably including at least seven modern and multivariate
plots with nice formatted should be ok.
Use Markdown to write a professional report that has topics, subtopics, table of contents, references, full sentences etc.
Give a name to this .ipynb notebook for the report that includes your name and dataset name like {yusuf}-{iris}.
Update/add topic titles, include Python codes and show in the report, remove my comments given in {}.
Reflect the theories and methods learnt the course: we have all developed the cookbook so feel free to implement some.
Once you finish the work, run all cells, save and export it as pdf. Your submission on myCourses will include both the .ipynb
notebook and the pdf files. Export as pdf will require some packages (or, trick is to export as html, then make it pdf print).
Make sure your pdf report shows all writing and visualizations.
And write the summary at the top of what insights and actionable analytics you obtained from the visualizations with
Seaborn.
Missing any instruction here and in the doc will cause losing points.
