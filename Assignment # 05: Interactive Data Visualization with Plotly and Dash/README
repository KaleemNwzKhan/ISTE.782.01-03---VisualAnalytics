You will keep expanding your viz design and notebook in Assignment-4.
You will use your notebook and the same data, and add the design of interactive dynamic visualizations made with Plotly Express
and Plotly Dash. Then, in a paragraph, you will narrate the interactive design and your experience. I assume you practiced all the workshops #6, #7 and #8 on Plotly and Plotly Dash. Review the workshops and visit the Dash
Core Components Gallery at https://dash.plotly.com/dash-core-components. Open the notebook submitted from Assignment-4, make a copy, and design any three interactive charts using Plotly Express (px). Feel free to make more vizs.
Then, use the same px's charts and apply the plotly dash interactive component (just one) to each chart like dropdown or
slider or else. 
Observe the capacities of interactive features. In the notebook, narrate what you have designed and your experience in a
paragraph using Notebook's Markdown.
